# DogeBeGone

DogeBeGone is a Chrome extension that saves your precious eyes from the _genius_ creation of Elon Musk, who decided it was a **brilliant** idea to replace the classic Twitter icon with a Doge icon. Because, you know, who doesn't love a good pump and dump on their digital town square?

## Features

- Saves you from having to witness the artistic _masterpiece_ of a Doge icon every time you visit Twitter.
- **WIP:** Reverts the Twitter icon back to its original bird form, just like nature intended.

## Installation

To install DogeBeGone locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download it as a zip file and extract it.
2. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the DogeBeGone Chrome extension files.

Now, you can enjoy Twitter without being _distracted_ by Elon Musk's junior dev prowess.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, just visit [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and let DogeBeGone work its magic. The Doge icon will be gone, and the bird will fly back to its rightful place.

## Limitations

* The Doge icon on first load is still present.
* The extension hides the Doge icon but doesn't currently replace it with the Bird.
