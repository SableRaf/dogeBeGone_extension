# DogeBeGone

DogeBeGone is a Chrome extension that saves your precious eyes from the scourge of Doge and reverts the Twitter icon back to its original bird form, just like nature intended.

## Installation

To install DogeBeGone locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download it as a zip file and extract it.
2. Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the DogeBeGone Chrome extension files.

Now, you can enjoy Twitter without being _distracted_ by Elon Musk's junior dev prowess.

## Usage

Once the extension is installed, just visit [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) and let DogeBeGone work its magic. The Doge icon will be gone, and the bird will fly back to its rightful place (WIP)

## Limitations

* The extension hides the Doge icon but doesn not currently replace it with the Bird
